                <p>
                    Fewer refills = better hydration—all thanks to the Owala 
                    40oz Tumbler. But this is no ordinary insulated cup. It 
                    also has an awesome 2-in-1, sip-or-swig lid. The Owala 
                    Tumbler fits easily into most cup holders, making it the 
                    perfect car companion. Oh and did we mention it is 
                    splash-resistant? Like seriously splash-resistant.

                <p>
                    My parents, the Owala FreeSip, are really proud of me. Why? 
                    Because I’m tough, never leak (when closed), am loads of 
                    fun to drink from, and always keep my cool. I’m kind of the 
                    perfect child.
