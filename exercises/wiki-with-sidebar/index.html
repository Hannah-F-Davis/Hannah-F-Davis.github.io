                <p>
                    Chick-fil-A, Inc. (/ˌtʃɪkfɪˈleɪ/ CHIK-fil-AY, a play on the 
                    American English pronunciation of "filet") is an American 
                    fast food restaurant chain and the largest chain 
                    specializing in chicken sandwiches.[5] Headquartered in 
                    College Park, Georgia, Chick-fil-A operates 3,059 
                    restaurants across 48 states, as well as in the District of 
                    Columbia and Puerto Rico.[1][6] The company also has 
                    operations in Canada, and previously had restaurants in the 
                    United Kingdom and South Africa. The restaurant has a 
                    breakfast menu, as well as a lunch and dinner menu. The 
                    chain also provides catering services.[7] Chick-fil-A calls 
                    its specialty the "original chicken sandwich". It is a 
                    piece of deep-fried breaded boneless chicken breast served 
                    on a toasted bun with two slices of dill pickle, or with 
                    lettuce, tomato, and cheese.[8]

                <p>
                    Many of the company's values are influenced by the 
                    Christian religious beliefs of its late founder, S. Truett 
                    Cathy (1921–2014), a devout Southern Baptist. Reflecting a 
                    commitment to Sunday Sabbatarianism, all Chick-fil-A 
                    restaurants are closed for business on Sundays,[9][10] 
                    Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day.[11] During the Western 
                    Christian liturgical season of Lent, Chick-fil-A promotes 
                    fish sandwiches, following the Christian tradition of 
                    abstinence from meat during Lent.[12][13] The company's 
                    conservative opposition to same-sex marriage has caused 
                    controversy; the company began to loosen its stance on this 
                    issue from 2019.[14] Despite numerous controversies and 
                    boycott attempts, the 2022 American Customer Satisfaction 
                    Index found that Chick-fil-A remained the country's 
                    favorite fast food chain for the eighth consecutive year, 
                    and it has the highest per store sales of any fast food 
                    chain in the nation.[15][16]

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    The chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill 
                    (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett 
                    Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in Hapeville, 
                    Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, in 1946,[17] which is near 
                    the location of the Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly 
                    Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's 
                    patrons. It was later remodelled, reopening in 2022.[18]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1961, after 15 years in the fast-food business, Cathy 
                    found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich 
                    in the same time it took to cook a hamburger.[19] Following 
                    this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. 
                    The company's trademarked slogan, "We Didn't Invent the 
                    Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,"[20] refers to their 
                    flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. 
                    Though Chick-Fil-A was the first national chain to make a 
                    fast, fried chicken sandwich its flagship item, it has been 
                    shown that Cathy's claim to have "invented the chicken 
                    sandwich" is false.[21]
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 1964 to 1967, the sandwich was licensed to over fifty 
                    eateries, including Waffle House and the concession stands 
                    of the new Houston Astrodome.[22][23] The Chick-Fil-A 
                    sandwich was withdrawn from sale at other restaurants when 
                    the first dedicated location opened in 1967, in the food 
                    court of the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta.[17]

                <p>
                    During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by 
                    opening new locations in suburban malls' food courts.[24] 
                    The first freestanding location was opened April 16, 1986, 
                    on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[25] and the 
                    company began to focus more on stand-alone units rather 
                    than food courts. Although it has expanded outward from its 
                    original geographic base, most new restaurants are located 
                    in Southern US suburban areas.[17]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 1997, the Atlanta-based company has sponsored the 
                    Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in 
                    Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also sponsors the 
                    Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference 
                    of college athletics.[26]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2008, Chick-fil-A was among the first fast-food 
                    restaurants to become completely free of trans fats.[27]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In October 2015, the company opened its largest restaurant, 
                    a three-story 5,000 square feet (460 m2) restaurant in 
                    Manhattan.[28][29] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On December 17, 2017, Chick-fil-A broke their tradition and 
                    opened on a Sunday to prepare meals for passengers left 
                    stranded during a power outage at Atlanta 
                    Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport,[32] and on 
                    January 13, 2019, a Chick-fil-A franchise in Mobile, 
                    Alabama, opened on Sunday to honor a birthday wish of a 
                    14-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and autism.[33]
                </p>
                <p>
                    On February 13, 2023, they began offering their first 
                    non-meat sandwich, a breaded cauliflower sandwich.[34]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In May 2023, Chick-fil-A closed its original location in 
                    Greenbriar Mall, without stating a reason.[35]
