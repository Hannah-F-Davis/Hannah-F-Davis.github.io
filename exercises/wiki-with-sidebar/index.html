                <p>
                    Chick-fil-A, Inc. (/ˌtʃɪkfɪˈleɪ/ CHIK-fil-AY, a play on the 
                    American English pronunciation of "filet") is an American 
                    fast food restaurant chain and the largest chain 
                    specializing in chicken sandwiches.<sup>[5]</sup> 
                    Headquartered in College Park, Georgia, Chick-fil-A 
                    operates 3,059 restaurants across 48 states, as well as in 
                    the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.<sup>[1][6]</sup> 
                    The company also has operations in Canada, and previously 
                    had restaurants in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The 
                    restaurant has a breakfast menu, as well as a lunch and 
                    dinner menu. The chain also provides catering services.
                    <sup>[7]</sup> Chick-fil-A calls its specialty the 
                    "original chicken sandwich". It is a piece of deep-fried 
                    breaded boneless chicken breast served on a toasted bun 
                    with two slices of dill pickle, or with lettuce, tomato, 
                    and cheese.<sup>[8]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the company's values are influenced by the 
                    Christian religious beliefs of its late founder, S. Truett 
                    Cathy (1921–2014), a devout Southern Baptist. Reflecting a 
                    commitment to Sunday Sabbatarianism, all Chick-fil-A 
                    restaurants are closed for business on Sundays,<sup>[9][10]
                    </sup> Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day.<sup>[11]</sup> 
                    During the Western Christian liturgical season of Lent, 
                    Chick-fil-A promotes fish sandwiches, following the 
                    Christian tradition of abstinence from meat during Lent.
                    <sup>[12][13]</sup> The company's conservative opposition 
                    to same-sex marriage has caused controversy; the company 
                    began to loosen its stance on this issue from 2019.
                    <sup>[14]</sup> Despite numerous controversies and boycott 
                    attempts, the 2022 American Customer Satisfaction Index 
                    found that Chick-fil-A remained the country's favorite fast 
                    food chain for the eighth consecutive year, and it has the 
                    highest per store sales of any fast food chain in the 
                    nation.<sup>[15][16]</sup>

                <h3>History</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill 
                    (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett 
                    Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in Hapeville, 
                    Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, in 1946,<sup>[17]</sup> which 
                    is near the location of the Ford Motor Company Atlanta
                    Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the 
                    restaurant's patrons. It was later remodelled, reopening in 
                    2022.<sup>[18]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1961, after 15 years in the fast-food business, Cathy 
                    found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich 
                    in the same time it took to cook a hamburger.<sup>[19]</sup>
                    Following this discovery, he registered the name 
                    Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, 
                    "We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,"
                    <sup>[20]</sup> refers to their flagship menu item, the 
                    Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. Though Chick-Fil-A was the 
                    first national chain to make a fast, fried chicken 
                    sandwich its flagship item, it has been shown that Cathy's 
                    claim to have "invented the chicken sandwich" is false.
                    <sup>[21]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 1964 to 1967, the sandwich was licensed to over fifty 
                    eateries, including Waffle House and the concession stands 
                    of the new Houston Astrodome.<sup>[22][23]</sup> The 
                    Chick-Fil-A sandwich was withdrawn from sale at other 
                    restaurants when the first dedicated location opened in 
                    1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta.
                    <sup>[17]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by 
                    opening new locations in suburban malls' food courts.
                    <sup>[24]</sup>The first freestanding location was opened 
                    April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, 
                    Georgia,<sup>[25]</sup> and the company began to focused
                    more on stand-alone units rather than food courts. 
                    Although it has expanded outward from its 
                    original geographic base, most new restaurants are located 
                    in Southern US suburban areas.<sup>[17]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 1997, the Atlanta-based company has sponsored the 
                    Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in 
                    Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also sponsors the 
                    Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference 
                    of college athletics.<sup>[26]</sup>

                <p>
                    In 2008, Chick-fil-A was among the first fast-food 
                    restaurants to become completely free of trans fats.

                <p>
                    In October 2015, the company opened its largest restaurant, 
                    a three-story 5,000 square feet (460 m2) restaurant in 
                    Manhattan.<sup>[28][29]</sup>

                <p>
                    On December 17, 2017, Chick-fil-A broke their tradition and 
                    opened on a Sunday to prepare meals for passengers left 
                    stranded during a power outage at Atlanta 
                    Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport,<sup>[32]</sup> 
                    and on January 13, 2019, a Chick-fil-A franchise in Mobile, 
                    Alabama, opened on Sunday to honor a birthday wish of a 
                    14-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and autism.

                <p>
                    On February 13, 2023, they began offering their first

                    In May 2023, Chick-fil-A closed its original location in

                    Chick-fil-A's business strategy involves a focus on a small 
                    menu and on customer service.<sup>[36]</sup> While many 
                    fast food chains offer many dishes, Chick-fil-A's is 
                    focused on selling chicken sandwiches.[36] The name's 
                    capital A is intended to indicate that their chicken is 
                    "grade A top quality".<sup>[37]</sup> The company's emphasis

                    Chick-fil-A opened a restaurant in Toronto, Ontario,
                    on September 6, 2019, in the Yonge and Bloor Street 
                    area. There were protests criticizing the company's 
                    violation of animal rights and "history of 
                    supporting anti-LGBTQ causes".<sup>[74]</sup> Chick-fil-A 
                    announced that it would open two other locations in 
                    Toronto during 2019, and 12 additional stores in 
                    the Greater Toronto Area over the subsequent five 
                    years.<sup>[75]</sup> The chain's second Toronto location 
                    opened at the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in January

                    The company expanded to other areas of Ontario in 2021, 
                    opening standalone locations with drive-through restaurants 
                    in Kitchener in August, and Windsor in October.

                    In August 1996, Chick-fil-A opened its first location 
                    outside of North America by building a restaurant in Durban, 
                    South Africa.<sup>[80]</sup> A second location was opened in 
                    Johannesburg in November 1997.<sup>[81]</sup> Neither was 
                    profitable, and they were closed in 2001.<sup>[82]</sup>

                    A Chick-fil-A operated in Edinburgh during Spring 2018.

                    On October 10, 2019, Chick-fil-A returned to Europe, with 
                    the opening of a store at The Oracle shopping centre in 
                    Reading, UK.<sup>[84]</sup> The store closed in March 2020 
                    after The Oracle opted not to continue the lease of the 
                    location beyond the six-month pilot period in the face of 
                    continued protests over the chain's anti-LGBTQ stance.

                    In February 2019, Chick-fil-A opened a store on a 12-month 
                    pilot scheme in Aviemore, Scotland. The store was closed in 
                    January 2020 amidst protest and controversy from locals and 
                    customers regarding the chain's former donations to 
                    charities supporting anti-LGBT rights causes. Chick-Fil-A 
                    said that they had always planned a short-term stay at the 
                    location.<sup>[86]</sup>

                    Later the company changed some policies, appointing its 
                    first head of diversity, in 2020, and focused its 
                    charitable activities on education and hunger alleviation 
                    rather than opponents of same-sex marriage. In September 
                    2023 the company said that it planned to open five 
                    restaurants in the UK from early 2025, investing over $100m 
                    over the following ten years in the UK. The chain said that 
                    it would apply its charitable policies, including a $25,000 
                    donation to a local organisation on opening a Chick-fil-A 
                    restaurant and donation of surplus food to local charitable 
                    causes, to its UK branches too.<sup>[87]</sup>

                    planned to open restaurants in both Asia and Europe by 2026, 
                    and was set to expand to a total of five overseas markets by 
                    2030. The Wall Street Journal reported that it was seeking

                    opening in Singapore in late 2025, making the first Asian 
                    country to open the brand, and would be investing US$75

                <h2>Advertising</h2>
                <p>
                    "Eat Mor Chikin" is the chain's most prominent advertising 
                    slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995.<sup>[9]</sup> 
                    The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring 
                    Holstein dairy cows<sup>[94]</sup> that are often seen 
                    wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read "Eat Mor 
                    Chikin" in capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily 
                    halted on January 1, 2004, during a mad cow disease scare, 
                    so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to 
                    be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two 
                    months later, the cows were put up again.[citation needed] 
                    The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an 
                    anthropomorphized chicken that still appears as the C on the
                    logo.<sup>[95][96]</sup>

                    Chick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property,

                    infringed on their trademarks.<sup>[97]</sup> The 
                    corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances
                    of the use of an "eat more" phrase, saying that the use 
                    would cause confusion of the public, dilute the 
                    distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish 
                    its value.<sup>[98]</sup>

                    A 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen 
                    prints T-shirts reading: "Eat More Kale" demanded that he 
                    cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.
                    <sup>[99]</sup>The incident drew criticism from Vermont 
                    governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what 
                    he termed Chick-fil-A's "corporate bullying".

                    formal announcement of his victory took place on December 
                    12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the 
                    Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and 
                    national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of
