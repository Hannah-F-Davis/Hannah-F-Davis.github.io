        </ul>
        <h3>Egg Wash:</h3>

            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Icing Glaze</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 puff pastry sheets</li>
            <li>granulated white sugar, for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <h3>Prepare Apple FIlling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>
                Add the cubed apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of 
                salt. Cook until the apples soften, about 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the vanilla extract, lemon juice, cornstarch, and 
                water. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens, about 
                2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let the apple mixture cool.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Prepare Cheese Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a bowl, mix the softened cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, 
                and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assemble Danishes:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Roll out the puff pastry sheets on a floured surface and cut 
                each sheet into circles using a large cookie cutter or a 
                glass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a smaller cutter, lightly score a smaller circle about 
                3/4 of the way through the dough in the center of each 
                larger circle. This will help keep the center from rising 
                too much during baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into 
                the center of each scored circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the cream cheese mixture with a spoonful of the cooled 
                apple filling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl. Brush the 
                outer edges of the pastry with the egg wash.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little granulated sugar over the edges.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bake the Danishes:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>
                Bake the danishes for 15-20 minutes or until the puff 
                pastry is golden and flaky.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The Icing:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, 
                vanilla extract, and milk or cream until smooth. Adjust the 
                consistency with more milk if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the danishes are out of the oven and fully cooled, 
                drizzle the icing over them and enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
