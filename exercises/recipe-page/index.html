        <h2>Apple Pie Danishes</h2>
        <p>
            Nothing beats the smell of homemade danishes fresh out of the oven, 
            especially when they look and taste like they’re straight from a 
            bakery! These apple cream cheese danishes are flaky, buttery, and 
            filled with warm spiced apples and creamy, sweetened cream cheese. 
            Whether for breakfast, dessert, or a cozy afternoon snack, these 
            danishes are a treat you’ll want to make again and again.

        <h2>
            <a id="apple-filling">Apple Filling</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The apple filling is the heart of this recipe. Start by peeling and 
            dicing Granny Smith apples into small cubes – they hold their shape 
            beautifully during baking and have a slight tartness that balances 
            the sweetness. Cook the apples in butter until they soften, then 
            add cinnamon, brown sugar, and a pinch of salt to enhance their 
            flavor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, here’s where the magic happens: to thicken the apple mixture, 
            you’ll need to create a cornstarch slurry. Mix the cornstarch with 
            a little bit of water before adding it to the apples. This step is 
            key – by dissolving the cornstarch in water first, you ensure that 
            it blends smoothly into the apples without clumping, giving the 
            mixture that perfect syrupy consistency. Finish off with a splash 
            of lemon juice for brightness and vanilla extract to tie all the 
            flavors together.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>PRO TIP:</b> Don’t overcook the apples. You want them tender 
            but not mushy, so they hold up in the danish.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a id="cream-cheese-filling">The Cream Cheese Filling</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            A danish wouldn’t be complete without that luscious cream cheese 
            filling. Make sure your cream cheese is softened to room 
            temperature – this is important because it ensures a smooth, 
            lump-free texture. Cold cream cheese will stay clumpy, and you 
            won’t get that rich, velvety filling we’re after.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whip the softened cream cheese with sugar, an egg yolk, and a 
            splash of vanilla extract (for extra depth of flavor!). You can use 
            a stand mixer or a hand-held mixer for this step. Either way, mix 
            until the filling is creamy and light, with no lumps in sight. 
            This adds the perfect tangy sweetness to complement the spiced 
            apples.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>PRO TIP:</b> If you’re in a hurry and forget to soften your cream 
            cheese, you can microwave it for just 10-15 seconds to take the 
            chill off.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a 
                id="shaping-rolling-pastry">Shaping and Rolling the Puff Pastry
            </a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Now let’s talk puff pastry! For this recipe, you’ll need puff 
            pastry sheets, and here’s a tip: roll them out just a little bit 
            thinner. This ensures a lighter, crispier pastry and gives the 
            danishes that bakery-style flakiness. Roll out each sheet of puff 
            pastry just a little. This step also helps you get more danishes 
            from each sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once rolled out, you can cut the puff pastry into circles, 
            rectangles, or squares, depending on your preference. For a 
            traditional look, cut circles using a round cutter. To keep the 
            centers from puffing up too much during baking, use a smaller 
            cutter to score a circle about 3/4 of the way through the center of 
            each piece. If you’re opting for rectangles or squares, you can use 
            a knife to score a slightly smaller rectangle or square – either 
            way, they’ll turn out beautiful!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>PRO TIP</b> Work quickly with the puff pastry and keep it cold. 
            If it warms up too much, pop it in the fridge for a few minutes 
            before continuing. The cold pastry will rise better and get those 
            gorgeous flaky layers.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a id="assembly">Assembling the Danishes</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Time to assemble! Spread a spoonful amount of the cream cheese 
            filling onto the center of each puff pastry piece, staying within 
            the inner circle you scored. Then, add a good amount of the apple 
            filling on top. Don’t skimp on the filling – you want each bite to 
            have that perfect balance of creamy, spiced apples and buttery 
            pastry!
        </p>
        <p>
            Brush the edges of the pastry with egg wash to give the danishes a 
            glossy, golden finish. For an extra touch of sweetness and a little 
            sparkle, sprinkle some granulated sugar on the edges before baking.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a id="baking-finishing">Baking and Finishing Touches</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Bake your danishes in a preheated oven until the puff pastry is 
            golden brown and crispy, and the filling is bubbling. You’ll know 
            they’re ready when the edges are puffed up and flaky, and the 
            apples look beautifully caramelized. Once they’re out of the oven, 
            let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before 
            transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. This helps 
            keep the bottoms from getting soggy.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a id="icing">Icing Drizzle</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            While the danishes cool, whip up a quick icing. Mix powdered sugar 
            with milk or heavy cream, and a splash of vanilla extract until 
            smooth. The icing should be thick but pourable. Drizzle the icing 
            over the danishes while they’re still warm but not hot, so it sets 
            nicely and doesn’t slide off. This step is optional, but it gives 
            the danishes that signature sweet finish you’d expect from a bakery 
            treat.
        </p>

                    <b>Different shapes:</b> Circles are classic, but feel free 
                    to switch things up by cutting the puff pastry into squares 
                    or rectangles. Rectangles are great for folding over the 
                    filling for an easy-to-handle danish, while squares can be 
                    folded into beautiful parcels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fruit options</b> Swap the apples for pears, peaches, or 
                    even mixed berries if you want to switch up the flavor. 
                    Adjust the cooking time for the fruit filling depending on 
                    the texture – softer fruits won’t need as long.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Make-ahead tips:</b>You can make the apple filling ahead 
                    of time and store it in the fridge for up to a day. That 
                    way, when you’re ready to bake, all you have to do is 
                    assemble and pop them in the oven.

            These danishes are best served slightly warm, with a fresh drizzle 
            of icing or a dusting of powdered sugar. Pair them with a hot cup 
            of coffee or tea for the perfect cozy morning or afternoon treat. 
            They also freeze well – just reheat them in the oven for a few 
            minutes to get that fresh-baked taste again!

                glass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a smaller cutter, lightly score a smaller circle about 
                3/4 of the way through the dough in the center of each 
                larger circle. This will help keep the center from rising 
                too much during baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into 
                the center of each scored circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the cream cheese mixture with a spoonful of the cooled 
                apple filling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl. Brush the 
                outer edges of the pastry with the egg wash.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little granulated sugar over the edges.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bake the Danishes:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>
                Bake the danishes for 15-20 minutes or until the puff 
                pastry is golden and flaky.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The Icing:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, 
                vanilla extract, and milk or cream until smooth. Adjust the 
                consistency with more milk if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the danishes are out of the oven and fully cooled, 
                drizzle the icing over them and enjoy!
